## Budget Preferences

- **Transfers**: Credit card payments and internal transfers should be tracked but not counted as "spending"
- **P2P Payments**: PayPal/Venmo can vary - context matters

## Reporting Guidelines

When generating reports:
1. **Auto Loan**: Report remaining balance and payment progress
2. **Recurring Services**: Flag if amounts change unexpectedly
3. **Transfers/Payments**: Separate from actual spending categories
4. **Savings**: Highlight as positive financial activity
